ROS filesystem consists of a catkin workspace directory. In the virtual machine it is ~/catkin_ws.

To create the catkin workspace, you'll have to make a designated directory and a src subdirectory.

Run commands -
 mkdir -p <catkin workspace dir>/src
 cd <catkin workspace dir>
 catkin_make # creates a catkin workspace, adds a CMakeList.txt in ./src, devel and build director in ./
 
The <catkin workspace dir>/src/CMakeList.txt is a high level cmake file telling how to build the source code, I THINK.

then, you can create and maintain your ros packages within the src directory of your catkin workspace directory.

Each ros package has it's own directory. No nested ros packages are allowed. i.e. a ros package directory can't be inside another ros package directory.

Each ros package directory has - 1. package.xml manifest file, carrying all the metadata about the package - maintainer, license, dependencies. 2. CMakeList.txt file.

So the overall template structure of a catkin workspace in context of ros will look like -

"""
catkin_workspace_dir/
	/devel/
		...
	/build/
		...
	/src/
		CMakeList.txt
		/ros_package_1/
			package.xml
			CMakeList.txt
			...
		/ros_package_2/
			package.xml
			CMakeList.txt
			...
		/ros_package_n/
			package.xml
			CMakeList.txt
			...
		...
	...
"""
