These are sensors used used by robots to perceive the depth of the surrounding world.

These are subcategories of sensors called Range Finders. Ultrasonic sensors, radar, sonar are some other examples of range finders.

Laser Scanners:
	Device that can measure the distance to obstacles
	Uses laser beams
	Used for several robotics application
		SLAM: building maps (Simulatenous localization and mapping)
		Obstacle Avoidance
		Navigation
		
LASERR RANGE FINDERS CHARACTERESTICS:
	Minimum angle: 	Start angle of the scan
	Maximum angle:	End angle of the scan
	Angle Increment (angular resolution):	Angular Distance between measurements
	Time Increment:	time between measurements
	Scan time: time between two scans
	Minimum Range: Minimum observable range value
	Maximum Range: Maximum observable range value
	List of Range: List of all measurements in a scan
	List of intensities: list of all intensities in a scan
