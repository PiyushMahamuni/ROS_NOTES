rosbag is a utility in ROS that allows to record the messages published by topics into a file, and them replay them again.
This technique is useful to develop and test algorithms and replay existing scenarios or experiments.

First of all start the roscore.
Start the node that publishes the scan topic. Either a simulated robot, driver for a sensor...
Create a static transform publisher ( The data we will record )
	rosrun tf static_transform_publisher 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0  1.0 map laser 10

Create a new folder to store the recorded information with rosbag
	mkdir bagfiles
	cd bagfiles

start the recording with rosbag
	Record every messages passing through ros environment
		rosbag record -a
	This way the rosbag nodes now subsribes to all existing topics and stores the messages published with a relative timestamps
	to stop recording you just press ctrl+c in the terminal where you are running rosbag

To see the recorded bag files, go to the dir from where you ran the rosbag command and there you'll find those bag files
To see the info of a bag file you can use - rosbag info <bag file path>
To play the bag file you just run - rosbag play <bag file path>
