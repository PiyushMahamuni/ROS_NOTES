In order to use the message types in your c++/python code you'll have to import thier libraries, similar to the services.

to include libraries in cpp file, you use -

#include "<package name>/<msg name>.h"

to work with turtlebots, we'll need to include-

#include "turtlesim/Pose.h"
#include "geometry_msgs/Twist.h"


to import libraries in python, you use -
from <package name>.msgs import <msg type>

to work with turltebots, we'll need to import -

from turtlesim.msgs import Pose
from geomtery_mgss.msgs import Twist
