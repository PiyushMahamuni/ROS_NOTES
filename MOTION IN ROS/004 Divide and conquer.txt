Steps to create cleaning application -

Step 1: Write a function to move in a straight line forward/backward for a given distance

Step 2: Devlop a function to rotate in place for certain angle, clockwise and counter clockwise

Step 3: Devlop a function for go to goal location / I already have implemented moveto behaviour in turtle_interact repo

Step 4: Devlop a function to move in spiral shape - ( function to continually change ratio of linear.x/angular.z )

Step 5: Integrate all together to devlop the cleaning application.
