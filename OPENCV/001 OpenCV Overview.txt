Whatever we've done so far in regards of turtlesim or Turtlebot3 is blind motion, motion without being aware of the surroundings.

In more complicated situations or for some applications it is mandatory that robot sees its surroundings for itself and makes the sense of the
world it lives in. That is it needs a to percieve the real wolrd. The methods and techniquest that allow us to do just that are collectively
called as "Robot Perception"

Now, computer vision implements methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images. So, computer vision is widely used
in robot perception to make the sense of the world for robot using a digital camera.

OpenCV is an opensource library that contains all the tools and techniques which are based on concepts of computer vision and it is very popular.
Computer Vision in on itself is very challenging to implement but we'll be delagating all those tasks to this library and just focus on higher level
implementation for our robots required behaviour.

OpenCV-
	- Open Source
	- BSD License
	- Free for both Academics and Commercial use
	- C++/Java/Python
	- Windows/Macos/Linux/IOS/Android
	- Strong Focus on Real-Time (Written in C++ and optimized)
	
Operations it can perform -
	- 2D Image Processing
	- Image input/output
	- Video input/output
	- Camera calibration
	- Video analysis (motion extraction, feature tracking, foreground extraction,...)
	- Object detection
	- Machine Learning, Deep Nueral Networks
	- GPU Accelarated Computer vision
	- much more...

One of the basic functionalities of OpenCV is to do the image segmentation.
	- It is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments
	- Used to locate objects and boundaries (lines, curves etc) in an image.
	
Another Operation - Image Thresholding
	- Thresholding is the simplest method of image segmentation
	- i.e. from converting a greyscale image to binary image depending upon the threshold.

Another operations - Drawing
	- i.e. Drawing different shapes.

Edge Detections
	- Find the boundaries of an object within the image.
	- Works by detecting discountinuties in brightness
	- Used for image segmentation and data extraction.
