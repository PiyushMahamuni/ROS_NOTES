INSTALL OPENCV
The installation of OpenCV in ROS Noetic on Ubuntu 20.04 has changed.

Use the following command instead

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-vision-opencv
In principle, this should work.

In case you face a problem with imshow (as I faced a similar one), you may try the following solution

sudo apt-get install libopencv-*
pip install opencv-contrib-python
use pip3 if you use Python 3

This should solve any problem with OpenCV (in case it happens) when you work with ROS Noetic.

In case you still face problems, it is recommended to make a fresh installation of ROS Noetic.

INSTALL USB_CAM
usb_cam package allows you to get access to the video stream of your camera through a ROS topic. To install the package:

sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-usb-cam
IMPORTANT NOTE
When you work with a virtual machine, make sure that the virtual machine has access to the USB cam to be able to run the code and rosnode related to the USB camera.
