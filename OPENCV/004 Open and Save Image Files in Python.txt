One of the basic functionalites of OpenCV is to open and save images from files.

Let's see how it works -

Very basic python script with OpenCV --
<code>

#! /usr/bin/env python

import numpy
# the data structure that will handle the image.

import cv2
# import opencv

imange_path = "absolute path recommended over relative path with the .jpg extension"

print("Read an image from file")
img = cv2.imread(image_path)

print("Create a window holder for the image")
window_name = "Image"
cv2.namedWindow(windwo_name, cv2.WINDOW_NORMAL)

print("Display the image")
cv2.imshow(window_name, img)

print("Press a key inside the image to make a copy")
cv2.waitKey(0)

print("Image copied to the folder images/copy/")
cv2.imwrite("images/copy/image_copy.jpg", img)

</code>
