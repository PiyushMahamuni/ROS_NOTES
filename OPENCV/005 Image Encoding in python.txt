We have seen the data structures that manupulate images with opencv and analyzed the contents of these datastructures.

However the image can be encoded in different froms that just what we saw in the last note.

This will be a brief overview of the image encoding. Let's first list out different ways of image encoding -

	- Grayscale ( only one channel depicting how dark or bright a pixel is)
	- RGB
	- Hue, Saturation, Value (HSV)
		- Hue Indicates the type of the colour that we see, in 360 degree format
		  Red - 0 to 60
		  Yellow  - 60 to 120
		  Green   - 120 to 180
		  Cyan    - 180 to 240
		  Blue    - 240 to 300
		  Magenta - 300 to 360
		- Saturation is the indication of how saturated an indvidual color is, i.e, the amount of the gray in the color
		  from 0 to 100 percent
		- Value is the brightness or the intensity of the color, from 0 to 100 percent where 0 is completely black and 100 is brightest
		  and reveals the most colour
