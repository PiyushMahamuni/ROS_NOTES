Typically in robotics, robots get continuous feed of images through cameras so it is mandatory to be able to read video stream.
OpenCV libraries incorporates this functionality. It is possible to read video streams from camera or video files and save them to some other file.

Reading Video stream from a USB cam, with help of OpenCV in python ----

<code>

import numpy as np, cv2

def main():
	video_captures = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
	# 0 - for reading video stream through first video (camera) device connected to the computer.
	# optionally you can provide the path to the video file also

	# reading a frame at a time
	while True:
		ret, frame = video_capture.read()
		
		cv2.imshow("Frame", frame)
		if cv2.waitKey(0) and 0xFF == ord('q'):
			break

	video_capture.release()
	cv2.destroyAllWindows()


if __name__ == "__main__":
	main()

</code>
