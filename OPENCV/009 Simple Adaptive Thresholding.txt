Thresholding is the simplest process of the image segmentation.

	- Very Simple
	- Operates on greyscale image (two dimensional arrays)
	- Algorithm:
		If a pixel value is greater than a certain threshold, it is assigned a certain value (e.g. 255 for white) and if
		it is lower than the threshold value, it is assigned another certain value (e.g. 0 for black)
	- Types:
		Simple Thresholding
			cv2.threshold(gray_image, threshold_value, max_value, threshold_style)
			There are different thresholding styles predifined in opencv ( The same names are defined as enumarator in C++ libraries just
			drop the cv. part)
			cv.THRESH_BINARY - max_val if gray_image[x,y] > threshold_value else 0
			cv.THRESH_BINARY_INV - 0 if gray_image[x,y] > threshold else max_val
			cv.THRESH_TRUNC - threshold if gray_iamge[x,y] > threshold else gray_image[x,y]
			cv.THRESH_TOZERO - gray_image[x,y] if gray_image[x,y] > threshold else 0
			cv.THRESH_TOZERO_INV - 0 if gray_image[x,y] > threshold else gray_image[x,y]
		Adaptive Thresholding
