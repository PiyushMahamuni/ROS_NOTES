Color filtering is an interesting technique in computer vision and image processing.

e.g. You have a yellow tennis ball on a turf. Clearly the tennis ball has very distinctive color compared to the turf and we can use this feature
to filter out anything which is not yellow to determine the location of tennis ball in the given image. or number of tennis balls for that matter.

Color Filtering -
	Displaying only a specific color range in the image.
	Usage: Detection of objects with specific colors
	
	Algorithm:
		Read image as RGB image
		Convert image to HSV image ( Since it is easier to define precise color range in HSV format, you have to define only Hue values
		and in RGB format the lighting will cause the color to be technically different where in HSV it just has different saturation)
		(HSV is more robust to external lighting changes, search HSV colorspace and you'll get it)
		Define the upper and lower color ranges
		Create the mask based on the image
	
	# Note -
	OpenCV uses different ranges for HSV -
		Hue - 0 to 180
		Saturation - 0 to 255
		Value - 0 to 255
