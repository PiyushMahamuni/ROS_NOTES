Contours -

	Edge (countour) detection is an image processing technique for finding the boudaries of the object with images.
		Contours are the curves joining all the continous points (along the boundary), having some color intensity
		It works by detecting the discontinuties in the brightness
	
	Usage -
		Useful tool for shape analysis, image segmentation, and object detection and recognition
	
	Algorithm -
		Read image in RGB format
		Convert image to grayscale format
		convert the gray image to binary image
		Find the contours using the cv2.findContours() applied to the binray image (using thresholding)
		Process contours (find its areas, enclosing circles, perimeter, moment and centroid)


Contours Hierarchy-
	In opencv contours follow certain hierarchy
	
	In an image some shapes are inside the others
	The outer shape is called parent, and the inner shape is the child
	Because of this, There are several ways to retrieve the contours from an image.
	
	RETR_LIST: The simplest way is to retrieve contours as a list. Doesn't create any parent child relationships. Parents and child are equal under
	this rule (i.e. they are all just contours of the same heirarchy)
	
	RETR_EXTERNAL: If you use this flag, it returns only extreme outer flags. All child contours are left behind. We can say under this law, only
	the eldest in the every countour family is taken care of.
	
	RETR_CCOMP: This flags retrieves all the contours and arranges them to a 2-level hierarchy. ie external contours of the object (ie its
	boundary) are placed in hiercarchy 1. And the contours of holes inside object (if any) are placed in hierarchy-2
	
	RETR_TREE: It retrieves all the contours and creates a full family hierarchy tree.
