# We discuss the some details and psuedo code to track a colored ball

# We will identify the ball using color filtering in an image. Then we detect the contour of the ball, draw it's center location and
# an enclosing circle

What is color filtering?
Display only a specific range of colors in the image
Usage: detection of objects with specific colors

Algorithm:
	Read image as BGR image
	Filter color of the object (ball in this case)
	Apply contour detection
	Get centroid of the ball
	Display information
