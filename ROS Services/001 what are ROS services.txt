In ROS services we have a ROS client which sends out request to a ROS server which responds to these requests.

### Unlike topics, ROS service is one time communication.
	A client sends request then a client sends back a response.

### When to use ROS services?
	Request the robot to do specific action
	Example - move to point x,y. spawn a new robot in the simulator, trace a circle...

### The communication protocol is synchronous. i.e. The client will keep waiting until a response has been received from the server.
	You can specify a timeout - for how long the client should keep waiting to receive the response.

### with ROS topics, we had *one directional communciation (* - though the same node could be both the subscriber and publisher of a topic).
	But with ROS services we have a 2 step bi-directional communication.
	Step 1 - Client sends out a request to server
	Step 2 - Server returns a response to client
