Just like how it is possible to create your own custom messages in ros, it is possible to create your own custom services.

Here we are going to create a cient server application using ros services. Where the client is going to send two integer values to the server and
the server will send back the response, the sum of the two integers.

### Steps to create a Client/Server ROS service App
	Step 1: Define the service message  (service file)
	Step 2: Create ROS server node		(AddTwoIntsServer)
	Step 3: Create ROS client node		(AddTwoIntsClient)
	Step 4: Execute the service
	Step 5: Consume the service by client


### Step 1: Definig the service message.
	Step a:
	We'll need to create the .srv file for this.
	In your ros package directory, locate srv directory and if it is not there, create one.
	Now we'll create a .srv file called AddTwoInts.srv
	Edit this file to have the following contents -
	<contents>
	int64 a		# Request part
	int64 b
	---			# seperation between request and response part
	int64 sum	# Response Part
	</contents>
	
	This file is called the service definition, defining the request calls and response calls
	
	Step b:
	Update dependencies in package.xml
	
	add build depend of message_generation if not already present
	add exec_depend of message_runtime if not already present
	
	Step c:
	Update dependencies in CMakeList.txt
	
	add message_generation package in package list of find_packages(catkin REQUIRED PACKAGES <package list>) call
	if not already present
	
	comment out/add 
	## Generate service in 'srv' folder
	add_service_files(
		FILES
		AddTwoInts.srv
	)
	
	Step d:
	compile your catkin workspace with catkin_make
	
	Step e:
	verify that service is created successfully.
	Go to /devel/include/<your package name> directory of your catkin workspace. There you should now find following files -
	AddTwoInts.h			# files that represents the service itself
	AddTwoIntsRequest.h		# file that represents the request call
	AddTwoIntsResponse.h	# file that represents the response call
	
	The other way of verifying that service is created successfully is to use rosservice info command with the service you want to verify
	
	
	add_service_file
