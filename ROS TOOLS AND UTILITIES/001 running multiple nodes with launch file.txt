There are often occasions when you need to start several ros nodes for your environment.
e.g. running roscore, turtlesim_node, turtle_teleop node, and your custom nodes

Repeating this same process manually every time can be avoided and be made automatic with using a launch file to launch these nodes

_______ UNDERSTANDING LAUNCH FILES _______

What are Launch files -
	An XML document which specifies:
		which nodes to execute
		their parameters
		what other launch files to include
	they have .launch extension
		
	roslaunch is a program that uses these .launch files and easily launches multiple ROS nodes
__________________________________________

The contents of the launc file ---------------------

<launch>
	<node name = "turtlesim" pkg= "turtlesim" type = "turtlesim_node"/>
	<node name = "clean_node" pkg= "ros_essentials_cpp" type = "turtlesim_cleaner.py output = "screen"/>
</launch>

---------------------------------

node - it is the self containing tag used to specify nodes to launch, it has name, pkg, type attributes
name = the name that will be used to identify the node in the ros ecosystem, it's optional and if not given default name should be used
type = the name of the executable file for the node
pkg = the package where the node is located
output - if not specified, you won't see the output of the node on terminal but the node will be running and all of its effect could be observed

Now store this launch file anywhere within your package with .launch extension, it's recommended that you dedicate a launch/ directory for all the launch files in your package.

To now run the launch file ( you don't need to run the roscore ), use `roslaunch <package_name> <launch_file_name>`
