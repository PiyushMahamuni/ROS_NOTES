If you want to control your robot / ROS environment remotely, you're likely to use a user machine which is in communication
with Robot machine over the net.

Let's call them just that, user machine and robot machine.
So you need your user machine/workstation to control your robot machine, for that we need to do some few number of steps


TO configure the robot machine, you setup some environment variables in ~/.bashrc
so that you don't have to repeat the process for every new terminal sesssion
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311
# 11311 is the default port number
Next we have to setup the ip address of ROS_HOST_NAME environment variable, to find out the ip address of the robot
machine, run `ifconfig` command in a terminal, copy the inet or ip address for given enterface like ethernet (eth1) or something else
let's say that id was XXX.XXX.X.XXX
set the ROS_HOSTNAME and ROS_IP environment variables to these ip address
export ROS_HOSTNAME=XXX.XXX.X.XXX
export ROS_IP=XXX.XXX.X.XXX

* For convinience, you can add echo statements as well telling how these environment variables are setup
echo "ROS_HOSTNAME: "$ROS_HOST_NAME
echo "ROS_IP: "$ROS_IP
echo "ROS_MASTER_URI: "$ROS_MASTER_URI

With these steps, you have completed the configuration of the robot machine.


IN your user workstation/machine, open the ~/.bashrc in a text editor
run the ifconfig to figure out the ip address of your workstation/user machine, you'll find different network adapters having diff IP address
copy ip address of the one that you have decided to use for ROS communications over the net

Now in the text file, we setup similar set of environment variables,
export ROS_IP=#The one you just copied to the clipboard
exprot ROS_HOSTNAME=#Same ip as ROS_IP

Now you need to make sure to specify the correct ROS_MATER_URI, Remember the ROSCORE is setup to be run on robot machine,
Now the robot machine has the ip address of XXX.XXX.X.XXX that we setup in robot machine's ~/.bashrc, so you set the
ROS_MASTER_URI as
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://XXX.XXX.X.XXX:11311
# 11311 is the defualt port number but make sure that you enter the correct one as you've setup in your robot machine's ~/.bashrc file

# in hindsight, ROS_IP AND ROS_HOSTNAME is the ip address of the workstation and ROS_MASTER_URI is the resource identfier for the ros core process
on robot machine

Just as with robot machine, it is a good idea to echo these environment variables in the ~/.bashrc file itself

With these steps, you have completed the configuratin of the user machine.


Now to test or setup your ros environment over these two machines, you need to run the roscore on your robot machine first
For an example also open a new terminal and launch the turtlesim_node on the robot machine

Now if you run the rostopic list command on your user machine, you should see all the respective topics related to roscore node and turtlesim_node
node

If you now close the roscore and turtlesim_node from your robot machine, and run the same command `rostopic list` on your user machine,
you should see an error, unable to contact ros master
