ROS let's you create your own custom messages for communication through topics you have defined yourself.

ROS Message Structure -
Recall that every message name is a composite of two parts - package_name/msgs_type
example - geometry_msgs/Twist,std_msgs/String, turtlesim/Pose

Every message types has different fields defined inside of it. example -
run rosmsg show std_msgs/String or rosmsg show geometry_msgs/Twist. You can navigate ro respective ros packages and see those .msg files for yourself

STEPS OF CREATING YOUR OWN MSG TYPE -	

STEP 1: Create a `msg` folder in your package directory

STEP 2: create a .msg file with name you'd use while prorgramming to refer to this msg type

STEP 3: Edit the .msg file file by adding the elements (ONE PER LINE), you can use `#` for commenting.
	You'll have to declare types of individula fields. These types are message types themselves which either you've defined yourself
	or are predefined in ROS libraries.

STEP 4: To be able to use your newly created .msg types, you have to update dependencies for it in CMakeList.txt file of your package.
	edit the part with the comment -
	## Find catkin macros and libraries
	find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
	# list of dependecies
	)
	and add the `message_generation` package in the list of dependencies there
	
	now edit another part of the CMakeList.txt file, find the part with the comment -
	## Generate messages in the 'msg' folder
	add_message_files(
		FILES
		# your .msg files with the extension
	)
	if this part doesn't exist, add it before all of the add_executable() commands in CMakeList.txt
	
	now edit another part of the CMakeList.txt file, find the part with the comment -
	###################################
	## catkin specific configuration ##
	###################################
	catkin_package(
		INCLUDE_DIRS include
		LIBRARIES <package name>
		CATKIN_DEPENDS roscpp rospy std_msgs <list of other dependecies> msg_runtime #ADD THIS msg_runtime here
		DEPENDS system_lib
	)
	
	Now make sure that the part with comment -
	## Generate added message and services with any dependencies listed here
	generate_messages(
		DEPENDENCIES
		std_msgs
		actionlib_msgs
	)
	is uncommented.
	
	Now you're done with all the required configurations in CMakeList.txt
STEP 5: Update the dependencies in package.xml file
	add build dependency of message_generation package and exec dependency of message_runtime

STEP 6: compile your catkin workspace with catkin_make to be able to use the newly created msg type.
