You can launch the turtlebot3 in various environments.

To launch the turtlebot3 in empty world environment you use -
roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_empty_world.launch

There is also a teleop node similar to that of the turtle_teleop_node in turltesim package
roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch

Another environemt for turtlebot3 is the World Environment, you'll see how its setup once you launch -
roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch
This env is similar to a kind of maze environment

Another useful environment is the Turtlebot3 House environment-
roslaunch turltebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_house.launch

Now a very important tool to be familiar with is Turtlebot3 RVIZ, which is used to make different kinds of visualization.
It stands for ROS Visiualization Tool. To start this tool you run -
roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_gazebo_rviz.launch
# One of the utilities of using RVIZ is being able to visualize data gathered from laser scanner into a sort of world-building drawing
# That is the world/environment visualized using the data gathered off of the laser scanner
You can also have the video feed of the camera of simulated turtlebot in RVIZ

There are also launch files for SLAM (algorithm to build maps of surrounding while exploring it)
roslaunch turtlebot3_slam turtlebot3_slam.launch slam_method:=gmapping
roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebote_teleop_key.launch
# to be able to make the robot move
