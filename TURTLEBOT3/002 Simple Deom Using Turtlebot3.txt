1. Let's launch the turtlebot3 simulation in the maze enviroment with 
roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch

2. In the same way we will start the rviz
roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_gazebo_rviz.launch

3. We will also now open the teleop node to be able to make the robot move and then as the robot moves around you will be able to see
the world is being built off of the laser data in the RVIZ
roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch


You can run the rosnode list to see the various nodes present at this point and also the rostopic list

Here are some of the topic that might interest you right off the bat -
/imu
/scan - has the laser scanner data
/odom

These 3 channels are from robots relative point of view what could be equivalent to /pose channel from turtlesim_node
