Localization, Navigation and simultaneous localization and navigation are techniques/concepts very important for mobile robotics.
These concepts/tools together will allow your robot to navigate complex environments, take motion decisions based on surroundings autonomously

The turtlebot3 ros package is what we will use in this part.

Turtlebot3 has several already defined environments
	
	Turtlebot3 empty world environment.
		roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_empty_world.launch
	
* To teleoperate the robot with keyboard -	
	roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.lanuch

	Turtlebot3 world / maze environment
		roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch
	
	Turtlebot3 house environment
		roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_house.launch gui
	
A very important tool while working with navigation and localization is RVIZ (ROS visualization)
	roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_gazebo_rviz.launch

	Turtlebot3 SLAM for map building
	roslaunch turtlebot3_slam turtlebot3_slam.launch slam_method:=gmapping
	roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key_launch
	

** gazebo launches have a default argument, gui. to start a headless launch, which puts less strain on your machine
** (you may want this since you will be using RVIZ anyway or not as interested in seeing the visualization of simulation)
** you can use gui:=false. e.g.
** roslaunch turtlebot3_slam turtlebot3_slam.lanuch slam_method:=gmapping gui=false
