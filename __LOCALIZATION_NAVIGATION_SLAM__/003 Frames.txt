Now the question, what is the location and orientation of the robot? We can obtain these informations like any other information with ROS topics.

start the turtlebot3 house simulation along with turtlebot3_rviz and find out the list of ros topics with `rostopic list`

Now in the RVIZ tool, the grid and map is shown. The grid has spatial distance of 1m. and the centre of the grid (literal geometric) is the 
origin point (0,0) and the location will be encoded with reference to this point.
This whole grid is what is called a reference frame. Since we use this frame to (refer this frame) to determine the location of the robot.

We can visiulise these frames using TF package which show us all the types of frames.
	Click the `Add` button at the left bottom of RVIZ tool, scroll down the list and add TF topic, after this you'll see axes of different frames
	along with map and grid on the RVIZ visualization window.
	
	You can now also see the list of available frames and even select the one you'd like to be visualized.
	You can choose one of them to be the fixed frame. Usually this is the global map frame and all the frames associated with your robot are
	free to move. You can change this setting and the data visualization will change accordingly.
	
	In summary, frame is a reference that is used to localize objects/robots

The topic that represents the location of the robot:
