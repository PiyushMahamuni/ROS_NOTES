Now we want to localize the robot's location. If you have observed the rostopic list, you will find that there are several topics that refer to the
locatoin or used /can be used to localize the robot.

TOPICS:
	
	/odom - represents the location of the robot based on the odometry information gathered so far
	
		run a rostopic echo /odom
		
		You will find several fields in the message.
		a header with seq number, time stamp and frame_id (telling what type of frame this topic is dealing with/ for which frame, the topic is
		publishing the messages)
		
		child_frame_id field, pose field, and a twist field
		
	/amcl_pose - represents the global pose of the robot in the environment with respect to the global map frame.
	* So it is important to keep in mind that the robot has different location values depending upon the frame you're looking at.
		
		run rostopic echo /amcl_pose
		The fields are identical to that of the /odom, that is both topics use the same message type
		Of course, these different topics publish values related to their frame.
	
	* In turtlbot3 simulation that you are running right now, you will find that in RVIZ the global map frame and odom frame are slightly shifted
	from each other. There might be some reason to this but becuase of this the values topics /odom and /amcl_pose publish are slightly different
	from each other.
