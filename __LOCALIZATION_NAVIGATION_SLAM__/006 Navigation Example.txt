Let's perform a small navigation demo

Typically we want to send the robot to specific location and robot should navigate itself to that location autonomously. This is simple with ROS.
We just need to send a goal location to the robot and the navigation stack will make the robot navigate to it while avoiding any obstacles.

In the ROS RVIZ, (start a turtlebot3_gazebo simulation and turtlebot3_rviz launch files) you'll see two types of planner listed in the left hand
side ribbon/tab. Global map (planner) and local map (planner). We can use the 2D nav goal button on ribbon below the title bar in RVIZ to send or
define the goal location in the robot. To define the goal location, you need to define both the positin and orientation.

After defining the goal location, you can see in the RVIZ visualization the static path being shown. This static path is planned with the help of
global planner and is obstacle free. Now the path is then followed ( or tried to follow to the best of robot's capabilities while avoiding any
unforseen/added or removed obstacles) using robot's local path planner. The local path planner has more narrow range than global one but is able to
avoid dynamic obstacles. (it real time feedback from the robot's sensor to map it's immideate vicinity while the global path planner worked with
a latest global map which is static in nature to set a overall path to reach the target location )
