Basic concept is that you have a robot in a (certain) space.
The next thing you think about is how to express the location (position and orientation) of that robot within that space.
This is the fundamental question for localization and navigation.

To specify the location of robot within a space, we need to specify an arbitrary location of a reference point in that space relative to which
we can locate the robot.

Learning Outcomes -
	1. Understand the concept of pose and coordinate frames.
	2. Represent the position and orientation of the robot in space.
