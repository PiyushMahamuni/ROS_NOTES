Imagine that you have a robot in space
The robot is located at certain position and is oriented towards facing a certain direction.
Pose is combination of physical position and orientation

To measure the position and orientation, we need to have a reference relative to which we can take this measurements.
Look at '003 coordinate frame and pose.png' from this directory. That is a cordinate frame in two dimensional space (since it has only two axis).
Here the name of the coordinate frame is `w` and location is respresented in terms of this cordinate frame. To make it apparent, the writing
convention is to represent the location as - (x^{w}, y^{w}, theta^{w}) - (8, 5, 45 degrees)^{w}
This is how the Pose of the robot is expressed in the programs, as a tuple.

Look at '004 Frame Example 1.png' and '005 Frame Example 2.png' to consolidate concept of frames.

Now that we have understood concept of Frame, how we can localize robot (any point) whose Pose value in known in one frame in another?
For this, we need to understand the concept of Frame Transformation. (that is converting a frame into another frame by means of algebraic
operations). This is explained in the note '006 Dealing with multiple frames.txt'
