ROS navigation provides the robot capability to navigate in real world.
It is done performed by two main components-
	Global path planner-
		Responsible for finding static path from initial location to the goal location.
	Local path planner-
		Responsible for following the static path generated by the global path planner while avoiding obstacles using odometry amd range sensors and
		environment map. 
	
However the navigation task is very complex and is governed by large number of parameters that need to be carefully
tuned so that the navigation would have the high performance. The correct tunning of the parameters require good understanding of their
effect. The objective of this section is to introduce a systematic approach to fine tune the ros navigation parameters to optimize the
navigation performance.

The correct tuning of the parameters require good understanding of their effect.
