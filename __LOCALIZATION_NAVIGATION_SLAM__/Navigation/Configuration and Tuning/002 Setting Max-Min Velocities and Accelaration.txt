The local path planner of the ROS navigation stack produces the velocity commands of type geomtery_msgs/Twist to control the robot motion.
For the optimal performace of the navigation it is important to set the minimun and the maximum velocities and accelarations relative to each
robot. In fact, these bounds for accelaration and velocities are tightly copouled with motors used by every robot and we need to provide the
navigation stack the estimation maximum and minimum translation and rotational velocities and accelaration for every robot.

WHERE TO UPDATE VELOCITY AND ACCELARATION INFO
	The parameters of the velocity and accelration are provided in the yaml configuration file of the local planner.
	
	For turtlebot3, the parameter configuration files are located at -
	/opt/ros/<version>/share/turtlebot3_navigation/param/
	
	[Use- roscd turtlebot3_navigation/param/ ]
	
	Open any file related to local planner and identify the velocity and accelaration parameters for Turtlebot3 robot.
	The question is how to estimate/determine these values?
	

	Run `roscd turtlebot3_navigation/param/`

	list all files with `ls`. You'll see bunch of .yaml files. Open any one related to the local planner.

	e.g. gedit dwa_local_planner_params_waffle.yaml

	You'll see the velocity and accelaration parameters mentioned right at the top of the file.


HOW TO OBTAIN THE MAXIMUM VELOCITY
	
	Run the robot with successively increasing velocity and note down the highest translational velocity upto which the robot is stable/not 
	slipping
	can stop safely.
	
	You can do this by not running navigation stack, just publishing the odometry information while controlling the robot via manually
	via a rc remote or a joystick.
	
	For rotational velocity, adapt similar approach. Start rotating the robot manually and keep increasing the velocity until the robot starts
	to lose its stability. Monitor the odom topic meanwhile and choose the upmost safe rotational velocity where robot didn't lose it's stability
	and was able to stop safely.
	
HOW TO OBTAIN THE MAXIMUM ACCELARATION
	Try to get it from motors manual(if available)
	*** The maximum accelaration from motors might be bit too much for the robot where you want to underspecify accelaration values in .yaml
	files to make sure robot operates safely.
	
	Write a node that publishes accelaration, and do similar practical tests as explained earlier for velocities to determine the appropriate
	values of accelratations.

HOW TO SET MINIMUM VALUES
	Set the minimum translational velocity to a reasonable negative value. This will allow the robot to move backwards whenever it gets stuck.
	
	Set the minimum rotational velocity to a reasonable neagative value. This will allow the robot to rotate in both directions.
	
	These parameters are used by local planner when robot gets stuck.


VELOCITIS IN X AND Y DIRECTION
	These are the velocites in the robot's frame of reference, not the global map's frame.
	Usually the robots are non holonomic - like cars (differential drive robots). i.e. they can't move in y direction and hence for these types of
	robots, the velocity in x direction is same as the translational velocity and velocity in y direction is 0.
	
The corresponding parameter names for behaviours discussed above are -
max_vel_x, min_vel_x, max_vel_y, min_vel_y, max_trans_vel, min_trans_vel, max_rot_vel, min_rot_vel, acc_lim_x, acc_lim_y, acc_lim_theta
