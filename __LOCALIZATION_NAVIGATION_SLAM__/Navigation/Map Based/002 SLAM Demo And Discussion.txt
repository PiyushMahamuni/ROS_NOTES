Here, we will discuss, how to build a map with ROS.

TURTLEBOT3 SLAM DEMO

STEP 1: start turtlebot3 waffle
	export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle
	roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_house.launch

STEP 2: open gmapping SLAM application
	export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle_pi
	roslaunch turtlebot3_slam turtlebot3_slam.launch slam_methodss:=gmapping
	# gmapping method of slam provides laser range finders based SLAM algorithm as a ros node called slam_gmapping
	# using slam_gmapping you can create a 2 dimensional occcpancy grid map from laser and Pose data collected by the robot.
	# Then we will make the robot move, to explore it's surroundings better and map them in this 2 dimensional occupancy grid.

STEP 3: Teleop the robot
	export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle_pi
	roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch

STEP 4: Save the map
	rosrun map_server map_server -f ~/map
	# we can use this map later for map_based navigation.


OCCUPANCY GRID MAP -
	In ROS the map of the environment is the two dimensional matrix which represents the grid structure. The grid is composed of cells which will
	be marked either free of occupied.
	Each cell has 3 possible states - 1. Unknown(Gray), 2. Free or empty (white cell - 1 value), 3. Occupied(Black cell - 0 value).

SLAM APPROACHES IN ROS -
	1. gmapping: contains a ROS wrapper for OpenSlam's gmapping
	2. cartographer: which is a system developed by Google that provides real time simulataneous localization and mapping in 2D and 3D across
	multiple platforms and sensor configurations.
	3. hector_slam: which is another slam approach that can be used without odometry.
	
	* NOTE - TURTLEBOT3 waffle model supports gmapping and cartographer slam algorithms.
	At first, all the cells of the grid matrix are marked unknown and as the robot runs the SLAM algorithm and explores the surroundings, it
	marks the cell as free or occupied.
	The quality of the map build is heavily dependent upon the quality of range finder and quality of odometry for the algorithms that use it since
	these two factors are the source of measurements.
