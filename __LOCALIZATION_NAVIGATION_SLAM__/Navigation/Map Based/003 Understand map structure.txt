To save the map built by the SLAM algorithm.
	rosrun map_server map_saver -f ~/map/tb3_house_map
	map_server is package responsible for publishing and manupulating maps.
	This node has the node called the map_saver which saves the map constructed by the SLAM process into a file to be able to use it for later
	navigation.
	This command generates two files, one image file with .pgm extension and another file with yaml extension.
	The pgm file contains the map itself the yaml file contains the metadat about the map, including the location of the image file of the map, its
	resolution, it's origin, it's occupied cells threshold and free cells threshold (confidence or probability to which the extent the cell is free)
	
	e.g.
	--------------------------------------------------
	tb3_house_map.yaml
		
		image: /home/<user>/tb3_house_map.pgm
		resolution: 0.05000
		origin: [-10.000000, -10.0000, 0.0000]
		negate: 0
		occupied_thresh: 0.65
		free_thresh: 0.196
	---------------------------------------------------
	
	resolution is expressed in meters/pixel - lower the resolution, better the quality of map.
	i.e. in above example it is 5cm per cell or pixel.
	The origin is a Pose (not 3 dimensional position vector, it's x cord, y cord and yaw angle - cclk is +ve)
	
	negate tells whether to or not to reverse the white black occupancy sematnics while loading the map.
	
	The .pgm is just a grayscale image (only one colour channel, which is representing the probability of occupancy)
	You can open this .pgm file with any text editor to see it's contents.
	You'll see something like this-

	P5 format encodes the numbers into binary code.
	line 3 encodes width and height of map (in pixels)
	the last line represents the maximum grayscale colour.
