ROS NODE FOR ROBOT NAVIGATION.
( Python version )

refer - https://github.com/PiyushMahamuni/roslearning/blob/master/src/Navigation/Map_Based/_01Set_Nav_Goal.py

NOTE -

	To figure out the cordinates of the goal location, open a terminal and run - `rostopic echo initialpose`
	Use the 2D pose estimate tool/button from RVIZ to select the target location, once you do that the initialpose topic will receive the
	cordinates of this target location as an update and you'll see those in the terminal. Now you can use this location as a goal values
	in your program.


UNDERSTANDING ACTION LIB -
actionlib uses asynchronous communication mode. i.e. the client is free to do other things while its request is being processed by the server.

UNDERSTANDING THE MoveBaseAction MESSAGE TYPE
	This message type is used to exchange messages between move_base actionlib server which has global and local path planners implemented in it
	which is responsible to making the robot move to the goal location.
	
	Contents ------------------------------------------------
	
	MoveBaseActionGoal action_goal			# defines the pose of the goal location
	MoveBaseActionResult action_result		# used to carry the final result of the request	
	MoveBaseActionFeedback action_feedback	# carries the intermediate results of the request
	
	---------------------------------------------------------
	
	The geometry_msgs/Point message -
	
	Contents ------------------------------------------------
	
	# this contains a position of point in free space.
