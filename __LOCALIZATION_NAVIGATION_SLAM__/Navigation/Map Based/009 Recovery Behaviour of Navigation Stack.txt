See ./009 Recovery Behaviour.png

When the robot receives the goal location, it starts the navigation process, and the robot will be in the navigation state.
The navigation means following the static path generated by the global path planner. (It might be the case that the global path planner was
unable to find the static path, in such case navigation never starts)

If the robot is stuck at any point during the navigation, (due to unforseen/dynamic obstacles or too narrow of path)

CONSERVATIVE RESET -
	The obstacles outside the user specified region will be cleared out from the map, (the frame and map which has been provided to the navigation
	stack). This user specified region is defined with the help of a navigation parameter. (we will see this parameter later).
	If the obstacles are cleared, then the robot continues to navigation state.

CLEARNING ROTATION -
	If conservative rotation failed to clear the obstacles then the robot performs the in-place rotation to clear out the space.

AGGRESSIVE REST -
	If the second action fails, the navigation stack attempts a more aggressive reset by removing all obstacles outside the rectangular region
	in which it can rotate in place.

CLEARING ROTATION -
	The above step will be followed by the required inplace rotation

ABORT -
	Even after following all these recovery steps, if the robot remains stuck then the navigatio mission is aborted.
	The goal is said to be non-feasible in such case.


These recovery behaviours can be configured using the recovery behaviour parameters.
