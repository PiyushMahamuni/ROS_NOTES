ROS provides very efficient and useful library - the TF package.
TF package embeds all operations related to frames and transformations, which makes it easy and straightforward to utilize them.

with the help of TF package you can -
	1. Manupulate frames in ROS
	2. Perform Transformations using TF package.
	

WHAT IS TF -
	TF stands for transformation library in ROS
	It performs computations for transformations between frames.
	It allows the find the Pose of any object in any frame using transformations
	
	A famous quote in robotics - "A robot is collection of frames attached to its different joints"	
	see image '002 frames in robot.png'
	
	You can observe that there are several frames attached to the body of the robot.
	The red axes represent the x axis for all those frames, while the green axes represent the y axis and blue axes represent the z axis.
	
	You can observe that at the top of the turtlbot3, there's a laser scanner and a frame attached to it.
