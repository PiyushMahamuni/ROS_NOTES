TF PACKAGE NODES-
	The TF package has several ROS nodes that provide utilities to manipulate frames and transformations in ROS.
		1. view_frames: visualizes the full tree of coordinate transform.
		2. tf_monitor: monitors transform between frames.
		3. tf_echo: pritns specified transform to the screen.
		4. roswtf: with the tfwtf plugin, helps you track down the problems with tf.
		5. static_transform_publisher is a command line tool for sending static transforms.

view_frames is a graphical debugging tool that creates a PDF graph of your current transform tree. command -
	rosrun tf view_frames

You probably want to view the graph when you are done, so a typical usage on Ubuntu sytems is:
rosrun tf view_frames
evince frames.pdf

Therefore an helpful shortcut to add in your .bashrc is:
alias tf='cd /var/tmp/ && rosrun view_frames && evince frames.pdf &'

Note: rqt_tf_tree that allows you dynamic inspection of frames.

* Usually the map frame denotes the global frame in ROS that is used to refer to the global loation of the robot and objects in space.
The odom frame is frame relative to the odometry motion of the robot.
the base_footprint frame is generally the frame attached to base of the robot at its center.
Other child frames refer to different components and joints of the robot.

Lastly in TF, the frames can be either:
	Published by a broadcaster node
	Susbscribed by a ROS node that listen to that frames
